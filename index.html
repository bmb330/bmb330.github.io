					<h1>What's This Here For?</h1>
					<p>Possibly you have stumbled upon this page on accident, navigating the internet, searching for something useful. So where have you landed? On some page of useless, random information? No! You have found a great treasure of the internet indeed! This is where I, Brandon Braun, will link to projects and experiments in the field of coding and software craftsmanship that I have had a hand in or created wholly myself. In the shortest explanation, this is where I will post examples of my work and training in software and web development. Please, have a look around and enjoy!</p>

					<h1>So Who Is This Brandon Guy?</h1>
					<p>It turns out that I am just an average guy, currently working in the IT field as an IT Consultant for a company named Atruent. Currently, my position consists of managing workstations and servers, of varying operating systems, assisting with the data center operations and servicing help desk tickets. For the most part, I do not have a chance to increase my programming skills in this position. In an attempt to correct this, I have taken on teaching myself programming in my spare time. Also, I am currently enrolled in the Community College of Baltimore County, to continue my education and obtain my Associates in Computer Science. Once completed, I am planning on transferring to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County to receive my Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>

						<section>
							<h2>Google Homepage Clone</h2>
							<p>This was my attempt at recreating the Google home page. I learned a few things during this process and although it's not perfect, I am pleased with the outcome of the project. Go ahead, take a peek and see what you think!</p>

						<section>
							<h2>echaSketch - an Etch A Sketch clone</h2>
							<p>The idea for this project came after looking over the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>, which is a free online coding course. The page includes an area that you can "draw in" with your mouse. The bottom of the page includes a reset button to allow multiple tries with this small application. The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with JavaScript and JQuery.</p>

						<a href="http://bmb330.github.io/calc/"><img src="img/calc.png" alt="JavaScript Calc"></a>
						<section>
							<h2>JavaScript Calc</h2>
							<p>Another project from the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>, this simple calculator uses JavaScript to recreate its features. In addition to basic math functions there are also memory and clear functions.</p>
