					<p>Possibly you have stumbled upon this page on accident, navigating the internet, searching for something useful. So where have you landed? On some page of useless, random information? No!

					<h1>So Who Is This Brandon Guy?</h1>
					<p>It turns out that I am just an average guy, currently working in the IT field as an IT Consultant for a company named Atruent. Currently, my position consists of managing workstations and servers, of varying operating systems, assisting with the data center operations and servicing help desk tickets. For the most part, I do not have a chance to increase my programming skills in this position. In an attempt to correct this, I have taken on teaching myself programming in my spare time. Also, I am currently enrolled in the Community College of Baltimore County, to continue my education and obtain my Associates in Computer Science. Once completed, I am planning on transferring to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County to receive my Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
